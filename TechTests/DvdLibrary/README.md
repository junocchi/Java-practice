# DVD Library - Java Basics assignment

In this assessment I created a program that stores information about a DVD collection. The program does the following:
- Allow the user to add a DVD to the collection
- Allow the user to remove a DVD from the collection
- Allow the user to edit the information for an existing DVD in the collection
- Allow the user to list the DVDs in the collection
- Allow the user to display the information for a particular DVD
- Allow the user to search for a DVD by title
- Load the DVD library from a file
- Save the DVD library back to the file when the program completes
- Allow the user to add, edit, or delete many DVDs in one session

## The DVD data transfer object has the following fields:
- Title
- Release date
- Rating MPAA 
- Director's name
- Studio
- Notes (allows the user to enter additional information, e.g., "Good family movie")
